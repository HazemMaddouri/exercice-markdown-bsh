## Readable texts
A markdown file is a Readable file with a "md" extension that usualy describe something. Everytime you create a new repository, github suggest you to ad a [Readme file](README.md).
## what can you do with markdown
## lists
you can create ordered lists like this:
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

but also unordered lists with bullets instead of numbers, like this:
- first bullet
- second bullet
- third bullet

but also lists within lists like this:
1. First list
   - first
   - second
   - third
   
2. second list
    - first
    - second
    - third
